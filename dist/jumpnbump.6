.SH LEVELS
There are two programs to help you make your own levels: jnbpack and jnbunpack.
.PP
jnbpack -o /tmp/newlevel.dat <file1> <file2> <file3> etc
.PP
or you can just put all the files in a dir, cd to that dir and do
.PP
jnbpack -o /tmp/newlevel.dat *
.PP
and it will put all the files in the current dir inside the packfile.
Don't try things like jnbpack -o stuff.dat ../file.c because it will add
"../file.c" as the filename in the packfile, which won't work.
.PP
jnbunpack level.dat
.br
will unpack it in the current directory.
.PP
With gobpack you can convert .gob files (which are sprites, described in
gob.txt) into .pcx files which you can edit with gimp for example, then
convert back to a .gob and use it in your own level.
.PP
gobpack -u font menu.pcx
.PP
will unpack font.gob using the color palette from menu.pcx and write the
files font.pcx font.txt. The other gob files should use level.pcx for the
correct palette.
.PP
gobpack font
.PP
will generate font.gob from font.pcx and the specifications in font.txt.
The .pcx files should be resaved with another program, as they are not
packed and are thus very large.
