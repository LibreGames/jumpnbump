Makefile to initialize some packaging-specific constants.

## Dependencies

- Jump 'n Bump

## History

Jump 'n Bump Menu was written in 2002 by Martin Willemoes Hansen. This
version is derived from the upstream version 0.6, subsequently maintained
by the Debian jumpnbump packagers.

It was integrated in the main Jump 'n Bump repository in 2017 for the
version 1.60 of the game.

There exists a Mono/Gtk# version of Jump 'n Bump Menu by its original
author, though only available via archive.org. You can find the latest
tarball on this [GitLab issue](https://gitlab.com/LibreGames/jumpnbump/issues/23).
