<H2>SECRET CODES</H2>

You can type these while in the game
<BR>

jetpack - you can fly
<BR>

pogostick - the bunnies keep jumping
<BR>

bunniesinspace - gravity is lower, you can jump higher
<BR>

lordoftheflies - the flies are attracted
<BR>

bloodisthickerthanwater - water turns to blood
<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>LEVELS</H2>

There are two programs to help you make your own levels: jnbpack and jnbunpack.
<P>

jnbpack -o /tmp/newlevel.dat &lt;file1&gt; &lt;file2&gt; &lt;file3&gt; etc
<P>

or you can just put all the files in a dir, cd to that dir and do
<P>

jnbpack -o /tmp/newlevel.dat *
<P>

and it will put all the files in the current dir inside the packfile.
Don't try things like jnbpack -o stuff.dat ../file.c because it will add
&quot;../file.c&quot; as the filename in the packfile, which won't work.
<P>

jnbunpack level.dat
<BR>

will unpack it in the current directory.
<P>

With gobpack you can convert .gob files (which are sprites, described in
gob.txt) into .pcx files which you can edit with gimp for example, then
convert back to a .gob and use it in your own level.
<P>

gobpack -u font menu.pcx
<P>

will unpack font.gob using the color palette from menu.pcx and write the
files font.pcx font.txt. The other gob files should use level.pcx for the
correct palette.
<P>

gobpack font
<P>

will generate font.gob from font.pcx and the specifications in font.txt.
The .pcx files should be resaved with another program, as they are not
packed and are thus very large.
